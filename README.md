This is a website representing Maria, a train passenger.

This is part of a demo for [Ã†TERNAM](https://aeternam.eu/), it shows how a passenger can buy a train ticket while staying in control of their data in a "self-sovereign" way. A "Passenger Name Record" (PNR) is created and governed by XDI link contracts that allow different involved parties to view and update it in various ways.
